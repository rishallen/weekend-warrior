# Roman Numeral Reverter

Write a program that, given a _string_ representing a Roman numeral, returns its value using Arabic numerals. For example, if given the string __III__, the program should return the Arabic value __3__. Important considerations must be given to the order of the numerals, as the system used [subtractive notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation) to avoid repeating the same character more than four times (i.e., __IV__ for __4__ instead of __IIII__).

For more information about how to construct Roman numerals, please consult the [Wikipedia article on Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals).
